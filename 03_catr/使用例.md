../../target/debug/catr empty.txt fox.txt spiders.txt the-bustle.txt
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Don't worry, spiders,
I keep house
casually.
The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth,—

The sweeping up the heart,
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity.
